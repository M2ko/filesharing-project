Home made filesharing website for home LAN hosted on Raspberry Pi. Done mostly as a Python practice project.

It has Python REST API backend. Supports uploading and downloading, moving through folders and deleting files.
Files are all located in the ~/root/ folder and not in a database. Idea behind this decision was to make it sort of
a GUI for navigating Raspberry Pi for fun. This project will also work as a security testing environment once I do more on it.

To do list:
  -Switch from bottle developement server to nginx
  -HTTPS
  -Better looking front end
  -More things
